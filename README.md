# mysqldumper

This is a python script that allows you to dump a mysql databse. If you ever find yourself having to use sql quries to traverse a whole db and hunt for potential info then this is for you : )

I use this script to dump the contents of the tables and non default DBs into a text file that can allow you to easily open in your text editor and then use crtl f to search for interesting info. It also tries to point out interesting information via string search
